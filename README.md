# siamese-one-shot-recogniser
This repo is an implenetation of a siamese one shot network, to identify like faces from an input 100x100 image.
The model is a slightly adapted implementation of the model propsed in the "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition, (G.Koch)".

## Stucture
1) `Model_Development.ipby` Is a full development pipeline for generating the siames model.
2) `app` is a Kivy implementation for the python model.
